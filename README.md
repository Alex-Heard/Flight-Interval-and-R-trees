# Flight-Interval-and-R-trees
Using both interval trees and r-trees to store large amounts of flight data to see which one performs better for flight tracking software

To run this project, pull into CLion and run the code. You will also have to inport the flight data file so the code can read the data from the file. A menu will be displayed in the terminal which will allow you to load, compare, insert, and search the trees. If you choose to quit option you will have to rerun the code.
